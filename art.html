      <p class="description">This is Gilberto hes based off of a frog I used layerd fern glaze and he turned out like this hes a wonderful little man. 
        How I made him was by just grabing a chunk of clay and just thinking of a frog. my primary challenge was make it all even and I kinda just let the clay do its think in that sense.
        the finished product is exactly what I wanted a dorky little pot. what im very proud of about this is color of the glaze and the way the eyes look like boba.</p>

      <p class="description">This is my coilpot project! There was no inperation for it but I really wanted to make something nice so I could gift it to my girlfriend (I think she liked it)
      To build it I first got some clumps of clay and used the coil extruder to make some coils and carefully placed them on top of each other then blended them and I put some green glaze with black spots.
      A major challenge I faced was the black spots on it, I was able to make perfect spots on it becuase the black glaze below it kept mixing/coming off while I was aplying the black glaze. This peice while its not 
      exactly what I invisioned I still very much enjoyed making it. For the future I want to try a different way to add glaze ontop of glaze or just do it in a whole different way.</p>

      <p class="description">(for Ms. Lima its still in the kiln so theres no photos) This was my tile project. my insperation behind it was my ideas on what I think home is to me. Home to me is what we all share in common
      and that would be the eath we all share the earth as our home. The way I constructed this was by making a flat tile first then getting a carving tool for the rivers and made little balls for stones and peices of wood
      for the fire. I then used a few differnet glazes bring some color and tried to make it look a little realistic. im very proud of the way it turned out especially the bridge and and the tent. One thing i couldve done 
      better on would probably be the bottom of the river. I really enjoyed making this.</p>
